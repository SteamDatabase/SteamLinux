> We're very strongly considering it! However, we've had some issues getting a single binary to work on both Debian Stable and the latest build of Ubuntu at the same time.

- [AirBuccaneers](http://store.steampowered.com/app/223630/)
> For Linux version there is more work that we have not done yet.

- [Beep](http://store.steampowered.com/app/104200/)
> Yes, I do plan to release BEEP for Steam Linux. Probably sometime in the spring though as I'm currently very busy.

- [Blocks That Matter](http://store.steampowered.com/app/111800/)
> We are currently talking with Valve to get access to the beta Steam Client. We were busy and missed the beta launch :( But I think on Monday we will have access to the client and the libraries!

- [Eschalon](http://store.steampowered.com/app/25600/)
> We're working on the [Steam] Linux version now.

- [Offspring Fling!](http://store.steampowered.com/app/211360/)
> I would say its about 50/50 right now...I need to change how the final application is built. I basically need to wrap Offspring Fling with software to make it into a Linux executable, but currently I'm having some problems getting it to work for unknown reasons... until I can work out these bugs, I can't get the Linux version onto Steam.

- [Q.U.B.E.](http://store.steampowered.com/app/203730/)
> We are currently working on a Linux port of QUBE, keep a look out in Q1/Q2 2013!

- [Reus](http://store.steampowered.com/app/222730/)
> Through this topic I want to officially announce that we are working on a Mac and Linux version of Reus.

- [Shadowgrounds](http://store.steampowered.com/app/2500/)
> We will probably bring the other games to Steam Linux at some point, at least Trine... but I can't promise it just yet so no ETA, there's some other issues involved (we didn't port them ourselves and they have a bit too many technical issues compared to Trine 2). But it will most likely happen at some point., the SG games are a bit 50/50, we sell them elsewhere but they bring a lot of support issues in their current state so we're hesitant to broaden the audience too much if we can't get the issues fixed... But we'll see how that goes.

> See Shadowgrounds.

- [Trine](http://store.steampowered.com/app/35700/)
> See Shadowgrounds entry & I think Trine is a given, just needs some time (i.e. spring).

- [Vessel](http://store.steampowered.com/app/108500/)
> We will! Gonna fix some multithreading issues first so its fast though.
