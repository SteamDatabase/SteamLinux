This is a list of games with a native GNU/Linux version that have been confirmed that they will appear on Steam.  

- [Achron](http://store.steampowered.com/app/109700/)
> We're very strongly considering it! However, we've had some issues getting a single binary to work on both Debian Stable and the latest build of Ubuntu at the same time.
- [AirBuccaneers](http://store.steampowered.com/app/223630/)
> For Linux version there is more work that we have not done yet.

- [Beep](http://store.steampowered.com/app/104200/)
> Yes, I do plan to release BEEP for Steam Linux. Probably sometime in the spring though as I'm currently very busy.
- [The Binding of Isaac](http://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/)
> Late January.

- [Blocks That Matter](http://store.steampowered.com/app/111800/)

- [Dungeon Defenders](http://store.steampowered.com/app/65800/)
> We're gonna talk to Valve about it so no guarantee/details/etc about it happening or not, right now.

- [Euro Truck Simulator 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/)
> Finally today we see the light at the end of the tunnel - Euro Truck Simulator 2 Linux port is almost finished. Very soon we should be able to start beta testing it. (January 11, 2013)

- [Garry's Mod](http://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/)
> I’ve been setting up servers on and off over the last month. Mainly to build GMod (pc, linux and osx).
[source](http://garry.tv/post/42030021399/catch-up)
- [Hacker Evolution: Untold](http://store.steampowered.com/app/70110/)
> We are working on it right now. It will be out as soon as possible and not later than the end of this month.
- [Offspring Fling!](http://store.steampowered.com/app/211360/)
> I would say its about 50/50 right now...I need to change how the final application is built. I basically need to wrap Offspring Fling with software to make it into a Linux executable, but currently I'm having some problems getting it to work for unknown reasons... until I can work out these bugs, I can't get the Linux version onto Steam.
- [Shadowgrounds](http://store.steampowered.com/app/2500/)
> We will probably bring the other games to Steam Linux at some point, at least Trine... but I can't promise it just yet so no ETA, there's some other issues involved (we didn't port them ourselves and they have a bit too many technical issues compared to Trine 2). But it will most likely happen at some point., the SG games are a bit 50/50, we sell them elsewhere but they bring a lot of support issues in their current state so we're hesitant to broaden the audience too much if we can't get the issues fixed... But we'll see how that goes.
- [Shadowgrounds Survivor](http://store.steampowered.com/app/11200/)
> See Shadowgrounds.
- [Shatter](http://store.steampowered.com/app/20820/)
> Eventually - our guys are pretty tied up just at the moment, but that's the plan.

- [Strike Suit Zero](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209540/)
> Developer Born Ready Games is working on Mac and Linux versions of Strike Suit Zero and it will support the Oculus Rift VR headset, all due out later this year.

- [Toki Tori](http://store.steampowered.com/app/38700/)
> About Toki Tori 1 Linux, yes we are definitely going to bring that towards Steam Linux, but we are still not sure when.
- [Trine](http://store.steampowered.com/app/35700/)
> See Shadowgrounds entry & I think Trine is a given, just needs some time (i.e. spring).
- [Vessel](http://store.steampowered.com/app/108500/)
> We will! Gonna fix some multithreading issues first so its fast though.

Probably not coming

- [Avadon: The Black Fortress](http://store.steampowered.com/app/112100/)
