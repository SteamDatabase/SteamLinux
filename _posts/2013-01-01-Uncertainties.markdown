Probably coming
---------------

This is a list of games with a native GNU/Linux version that have been confirmed that they will appear on Steam.  

- [Achron](http://store.steampowered.com/app/109700/)
> We're very strongly considering it! However, we've had some issues getting a single binary to work on both Debian Stable and the latest build of Ubuntu at the same time.

- [AirBuccaneers](http://store.steampowered.com/app/223630/)
> For Linux version there is more work that we have not done yet.

> Yes, I do plan to release BEEP for Steam Linux. Probably sometime in the spring though as I'm currently very busy.

- [Blocks That Matter](http://store.steampowered.com/app/111800/)
> We are currently talking with Valve to get access to the beta Steam Client. We were busy and missed the beta launch :( But I think on Monday we will have access to the client and the libraries!

- [Eschalon](http://store.steampowered.com/app/25600/)

- [Offspring Fling!](http://store.steampowered.com/app/211360/)
> I would say its about 50/50 right now...I need to change how the final application is built. I basically need to wrap Offspring Fling with software to make it into a Linux executable, but currently I'm having some problems getting it to work for unknown reasons... until I can work out these bugs, I can't get the Linux version onto Steam.

- [Q.U.B.E.](http://store.steampowered.com/app/203730/)
> We are currently working on a Linux port of QUBE, keep a look out in Q1/Q2 2013!

- [Reus](http://store.steampowered.com/app/222730/)
> Through this topic I want to officially announce that we are working on a Mac and Linux version of Reus.

- [Shadowgrounds](http://store.steampowered.com/app/2500/)
> We will probably bring the other games to Steam Linux at some point, at least Trine... but I can't promise it just yet so no ETA, there's some other issues involved (we didn't port them ourselves and they have a bit too many technical issues compared to Trine 2). But it will most likely happen at some point., the SG games are a bit 50/50, we sell them elsewhere but they bring a lot of support issues in their current state so we're hesitant to broaden the audience too much if we can't get the issues fixed... But we'll see how that goes.

- [Skullgirls](http://store.steampowered.com/app/245170/)
> Skullgirls is coming to Linux!

- [Trine](http://store.steampowered.com/app/35700/)
> See Shadowgrounds entry & I think Trine is a given, just needs some time (i.e. spring).

- [Vessel](http://store.steampowered.com/app/108500/)
> We will! Gonna fix some multithreading issues first so its fast though.

Probably not coming

This is a list of games that have a native GNU/Linux version but are unlikely to become available to Linux users on Steam.  

- [Super Meat Boy](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40800/)
> If Edmund and Tommy say to do it, we can get it up on Steam pretty easily, but I don't think they'd be interested.

- [The Binding of Isaac](http://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/)
> the more time that passes the worse it looks, it has to do with there being no original build of isaac that exists on linux only wrath and no being able to turn wrath off... still working on it but is not looking great
