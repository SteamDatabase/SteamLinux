This is a list of games with a native GNU/Linux version that have been confirmed that they will appear on Steam.  

- [Achron](http://store.steampowered.com/app/109700/)
> We're very strongly considering it! However, we've had some issues getting a single binary to work on both Debian Stable and the latest build of Ubuntu at the same time.

- [AirBuccaneers](http://store.steampowered.com/app/223630/)
> For Linux version there is more work that we have not done yet.

- [Beep](http://store.steampowered.com/app/104200/)
> Yes, I do plan to release BEEP for Steam Linux. Probably sometime in the spring though as I'm currently very busy.

- [Blocks That Matter](http://store.steampowered.com/app/111800/)
> We are currently talking with Valve to get access to the beta Steam Client. We were busy and missed the beta launch :( But I think on Monday we will have access to the client and the libraries!

- [Dota 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/570/)
> The Mac and Linux builds are currently in testing and will be available soon.

> We are working on it right now. It will be out as soon as possible and not later than the end of this month.

- [Natural Selection 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/4920/)

- [Offspring Fling!](http://store.steampowered.com/app/211360/)
> I would say its about 50/50 right now...I need to change how the final application is built. I basically need to wrap Offspring Fling with software to make it into a Linux executable, but currently I'm having some problems getting it to work for unknown reasons... until I can work out these bugs, I can't get the Linux version onto Steam.

- [Reus](http://store.steampowered.com/app/222730/)
> Through this topic I want to officially announce that we are working on a Mac and Linux version of Reus.

- [Shadowgrounds](http://store.steampowered.com/app/2500/)
> We will probably bring the other games to Steam Linux at some point, at least Trine... but I can't promise it just yet so no ETA, there's some other issues involved (we didn't port them ourselves and they have a bit too many technical issues compared to Trine 2). But it will most likely happen at some point., the SG games are a bit 50/50, we sell them elsewhere but they bring a lot of support issues in their current state so we're hesitant to broaden the audience too much if we can't get the issues fixed... But we'll see how that goes.

> See Shadowgrounds.

- [Strike Suit Zero](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209540/)
> Developer Born Ready Games is working on Mac and Linux versions of Strike Suit Zero and it will support the Oculus Rift VR headset, all due out later this year.

- [Toki Tori](http://store.steampowered.com/app/38700/)
> About Toki Tori 1 Linux, yes we are definitely going to bring that towards Steam Linux, but we are still not sure when.

- [Trine](http://store.steampowered.com/app/35700/)
> See Shadowgrounds entry & I think Trine is a given, just needs some time (i.e. spring).

- [Vessel](http://store.steampowered.com/app/108500/)
> We will! Gonna fix some multithreading issues first so its fast though.
